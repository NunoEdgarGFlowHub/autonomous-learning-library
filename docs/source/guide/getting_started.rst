Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

The Autonomous Learning Library requires a recent version of Pytorch (>= 10.3).
Additionally, Tensorboard is required in order to enable logging,
which requires the installation of Tensorflow.
We recommond installing these through `link Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`.

We have also tested on Unix-based machines (Linux and MacOS).
However, there is no inherent reason why it shouldn 

Installation
------------

Right now, the Autonomous Learning Library can only be installed by cloning the Github repository::

    git clone https://github.com/cpnota/autonomous-learning-library.git
    cd autonomous-learning-library
    pip install -e .

You can test your installation by running the tests::

    make test

If you do not have Make installed, the tests can by run with::

    python -m unittest discover -s all -p "*test.py"

Running a Preset Agent
----------------------

The goal of the Autonomous Learning Library is to be a library for building new agents.
However, the library includes a number of "preset" agent configurations for easy benchmarking and comparison.
It also includes some useful scripts for running the presets.
For example, an A2C agent can be run on Cart-Pole as follows::

    python scripts/classic.py CartPole-v0 a2c

The results will be written to `runs/_a2c <id>`, where `<id>` is some some string generated by the library.
You can view these results and other information through `tensorboard`::

    tensorboard --logdir runs

If you want to compare agents in a nicer, format, you can use the `plot` script::

    python scripts/plot.py runs

Finally, to watch the trained model in action, we provide a `watch` scripts for each preset module::

    python scripts/watch_classic.py CartPole-v0 "runs/_a2c <id>"

Be sure to check out the `atari` and `continuous` presets for more fun!
You will need CUDA and a decent GPU in order to achieve good performance.
